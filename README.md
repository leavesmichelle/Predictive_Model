# Predictive Modeling of Trial Outcomes Using Neural Activity and Stimulus Contrasts in Mouse Visual Cortex

This project aims to develop a predictive model for trial outcome using neural activity data and stimulus contrasts. The datasets the model is based off of consists of recordings from the visual cortex of mice during decision-making tasks. By leveraging the relationship between neural activity patterns and stimulus information, the model accurately predicts trial outcomes. The findings contribute to our understanding of how neural activity relates to decision-making processes and have potential implications for various fields, including neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
